title: 'From Tools to Adoption: A Path to Modular and Interactive Scientific Publishing'
---

## Workshop Overview

In San Diego November 6-8th, 2025 a group of 25 open-science leaders gathered for an in-person implementation workshop to unify modular scientific publishing tools around shared reference implementations. The working meeting, hosted by [openRxiv](https://openrxiv.org) and [Continuous Science Foundation](https://continuousfoundation.org) convened developers of leading modular publishing tools and licensing to create a working, federated reference architecture using real bioRxiv content, connected authoring tools, and worked towards shared standards. Our goal was to resolve technical gaps, demonstrate live interoperability, and lay the foundation for modular, machine-readable research publishing. The workshop was preceded by a virtual kickoff and included discussions and activities at CZI's Open Science Meeting and JupyterCon. This meeting was designed to unlock adoption by showing, not telling, how modular publishing can work in practice today.

Our approach for the workshop was to convene a small group of 25 leaders and tool makers in open science to align on a collective vision/demonstrations and implementations to drive meaningful change. Given the small size and implementation focus, this meeting was by invitation only.

This meeting is funded by the Meeting Fund of The Navigation Fund Open Science Program. [10.71707/gn91-ka32](https://commons.datacite.org/doi.org/10.71707/gn91-ka32).

## Abstract

Scientific content remains trapped in static formats that limit reuse, attribution, and machine readability, despite the availability of modern tooling that makes this possible and better matches how scientists conduct research. This initiative, led by openRxiv and Continuous Science Foundation, addresses this challenge through practical implementation rather than consensus-driven standardization. The project will convene developers of leading modular publishing tools—MyST, Quarto, Curvenote, and Kotahi—to create a working, federated reference architecture using real bioRxiv content and deploying through the newly created openRxiv labs. Through a facilitated virtual meeting followed by a 2.5-day in-person implementation sprint, participants will develop shared interoperability standards and demonstrate live reuse of scientific content. Following the successful ipynb model, the approach prioritizes working software over abstract frameworks. Key deliverables include a reference implementation demonstrating cross-platform interoperability, pilot deployments using bioRxiv articles, progress updates at the CZI Open Science Meeting, and adoption materials for publishers and platforms. This implementation-first approach represents a concrete step toward modular publishing that meets current needs while preparing for the LLM era.

## Tentative program for in-person meeting

- [ ] Turn these into cards and link to the days

Two and a half day, in person implementation meeting. This group of developers will convene for 2.5 days in a facilitated meeting with the following structure.

**Day 1 — Nov 6**
9am - 12pm: The first half day of the meeting will focus on discussion, following from our virtual meeting, identifying where there are coordinated development opportunities and small groups who will work together.
12-1pm: Lunch
1pm - 4:30pm: Small group discussions or beginning of exploring code together.
4:30-5pm: Lightning demos of what people are working on.
5-9pm: Rest and Dinner.

**Day 2 — Nov 7**
9am-10am: Recap from the previous day. What came up that we need to discuss or resolve?
10am-11:30am: Have discussion or work based on areas of interest, friction, or disagreement that we observed.
11:30-12:00pm Lightning demos of what people are working on.
12-1: Lunch
1-5pm: Continue work and discussions. Opportunity to add new ideas or switch projects.
5-7pm: Rest and Dinner.
7-9pm: Informal hacker time and demos.

**Day 3 — Nov 8**
9-10:30am: Demo and discuss where we are
10:30-12pm: Plan next steps and areas where we’ll communicate with each other
